Against the wall there is a beat up night stand with a little drawer built into it and an old phone on top. Next to it is a lumpy old bed that looks like it's seen better days, with a dark brown stain on the sheets and a funny smell coming from it. There is an obnoxious orange couch in the corner next to a small window smudged with sticky purple hand prints. The stuffing is coming out of the cushions which are also spotted with purple, and the floor is covered with cans of Fast Eddie's Colon Cleanse. The door that leads to the hallway is to the east. There is a door to the west that leads to that sweet sweet porcelain throne."
